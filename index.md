# Introducing the PrintNoser

The printnoser quickly and accurately diagnoses your 3D prints and
removes the need to constantly baby 3D prints. In the past, it was often
necessary or tempting to run between your office and your print area, but now
you can monitor from afar! Better yet, the PrintNoser algorithm can diagnose print
failures and notify you, so you don't need to deal with cumbersome video feeds.

## Purpose

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of medium-frequency print head acceleration measurements as a
diagnostic tool for identifying and alerting print farm managers and makerspace
employees of 3D print failures.

Anyone who uses 3D printers on a regular basis could benefit from the introduction
of this tool into their printing process. In particular, anyone who is
responsible for managing a large number of printers, or who services and
maintains 3D printers as a small portion of their overall duties. People working
in libraries or maker spaces are often in the position of needing to take care
of many 3D printers, or many different types of machines at once. Additionally,
in these situations many different people, some of whom not very familiar with
the process, use such publicly available devices to manufacture parts. This can
lead to reduced printer reliability, which we aim to fix.

## How it works

Our tool is based on data from an accelerometer mounted on the print head of a
3D printer. Modular and uninstrusive, it can be mounted and calibrated on any
printer, removing the barriers of expensive tooling that makerspaces and
students cannot afford.

### The mount

For figures 2 through 4,  **green** represents the y-axis, **red** represents the
x-axis, and **blue** represents the z-axis. The smaller arrows indicate the
coordinate system of the phone, and the larger arrows indicate the coordinate
system of the 3D printer control system. We chose coordinate systems with a
shared origin so all our analysis can treat position/acceleration changes in the
phone system to be interchangeable with position/acceleration changes in the
ground system or the 3D printer system.

## Outputs

For our first method of analysis, we developed a tunable layer of thresholding
on the measured acceleration signal. This type of failure detection is broad, but works well for
jerky or catastrophic failures. In figure 1 we correctly determined a successful
print and in figure two we detect a failed print situation due to a significant
irregularity in the signal.

Unfortunately, this method breaks down for more complex failure types. It relies on
the type of failure exerting a force greater than gravity for several measurements.
We eliminate false measurements in this technique by taking several max reading samples and averaging them.

### FFT Threshold Algorithm

This method did not work effectively. We expected to be able to measure the maximum
amplitude of the low-frequency ranges to detect catastrophic print failures. In our
failure analysis, we found that high amplitude does not equate consistently to
a failure mode â€” even when it occurs in the low-frequency ranges.
Narrowing to specific frequency ranges as a method of filtering
also does not work well, because after a large amplitude failure, the print head
often experiences some sort of higher frequency oscillation, which can shift the time-domain
signal that corresponds to a failure up and down the frequency-power domain spectrum depending
on the error.

</div> <p style="float:right; width: 50%">In Figure 6, this phenomena is shown
	in the signal FFT plot. Particularly, where the FFT output spikes around the
	30 Hz range. Rather than providing a clear and predicable low frequency
	spike, the FFT analysis output is both noisey and, relative to the system,
	high frequency. Note that this method is sometimes able to correctly
	diagnose failed prints, such as in this Figure, but only when the print
	includes virtually no other noise.</p>

### Linear Regression Algorithm

Our next attempt was to perform a linear regression process on the output of the
FFT in order to look at trends in the shape of the data. Our hypothesis was that
successful prints would be weighted towards higher frequency data and failed
prints would be weighted towards lower frequencies. As a result, the slope of the
regression should determine the status of the print. Potentially, it can even be
implemented to calculate ongoing regression lines as the print runs.

We use a simple threshold on the slope of the linear regression line to determine
whether the print has failed or not. Using this method, we reached a 100% success rate
among n = 18 samples, with zero false positives and zero false negatives. Going forward,
more testing is needed to confirm that the algorithm can successfully diagnose more complex
print failures and handle noisier situations like printing support material at high speed.
Already, the algorithm was able to reliably recognize our most extreme print test ([printing
a box with dense infill at 300mm/s travel speed](https://github.com/Inkering/printnoser/blob/master/GCODE/RECTANGLE_infill_faster.gcode)) as a successful print task.

## What's Next

The next steps of this project will be to improve the user experience and
software integration. Additionally, we will work to increase the number of
different failure modes which we can detect, including being able to detect
potential gradual decreases in print quality such as miniscule stepper failures.
