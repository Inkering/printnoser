# Introducing the printnoser

The printnoser quickly and accurately diagnoses the art of your 3D prints and
removes the need to constantly baby 3D prints. In the past, it was often
necessary or tempting to run between your office and your print area, but now
you can monitor from afar!

## Purpose

We built a diagnosis tool for identifying and alterting print farm managers and
makerspace employees of 3D print failures.

## How it works

Our tool is based on data from an accelerometer mounted on the print head of a
3D printer. Modular and uninstrusive, it can be mounted and calibrated on any
printer, removing the barriers of expensive tooling that makerspaces and
students cannot afford.
